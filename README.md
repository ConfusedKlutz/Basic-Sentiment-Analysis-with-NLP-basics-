# Basic Sentiment Analysis

This project demonstrates a basic sentiment analysis pipeline using a Logistic Regression model. The workflow includes:

1. **Model Training**: Training a Logistic Regression model on labeled sentiment data.
2. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict sentiment labels for test data.
3. **Evaluation**: Calculating and displaying the accuracy of the model's predictions.
4. **Visualization**: Plotting the distribution of sentiment labels in the training dataset.
